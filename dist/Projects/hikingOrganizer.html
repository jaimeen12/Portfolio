          <h3 class="text-secondary">Background</h3>
          <p>
            Groups of four were created and the aim of the project was to utilise Agile methodologies to create a Web Application which allows hikers to connect. An MVC architecture was used in conjunction with Pug as a template engine and passport.js for security. The App was deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform, utilising Travis CI for Continuous Integration.
