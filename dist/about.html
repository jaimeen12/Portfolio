          <p>
            My curiosity of figuring out how things work led me to choosing a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at The University of 
            Witwatersrand. The degree lit a spark of interest towards programming. On my journey I explored many interesting courses such as Data Information 
            Management, Networking, Web Development and Big Data. Towards the end of the degree, the spark of interest evolved into a passion towards the Cyber Security Field with current studies including TryHackMe Courses and HackTheBox Challenges.

          <h3>Big Data</h3>
          <h5>Parallel Programming</h5>
          <p>
            The Big Data course developed an understanding of parallel programming paradigms. PThreads, OpenMP 
            and MPI were used to efficiently compute data-intensive tasks. 
            The most interesting part of the course was when we were allowed to utilise the Jaguar Computer Cluster at Wits for our project.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <h5>NodeJS and Agile Methodologies</h5>
          <p>
            The course introduced us to Software Engineering practices utilized in "real-world" web application development. This includes Agile methodologies and Continuous Integration. It also showed me how to effectively produce a software product as a team.

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <h5>Machine Learning Assisted Wireless Communications</h5>
          <p>
            The course is not a traditional course, but rather an application of the knowledge acquired and also self-studying something completely new(Machine Learning). The course allowed me to get a deep understanding of how wireless communication works. It also allowed me to dive into the Artificial Intelligence world and explore powerful Machine Learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks.
